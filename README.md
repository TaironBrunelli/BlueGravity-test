# BlueGravity-test
The System Input was using the Unity Input Actions.
The Shop System was designed in a way that would make it easy to add more Shop in the
game;
The Player 'Selling Shop' was intended to Sell 'any item in their inventory' (that can be sold);
The Items were designed with a virtual Function (ItemEffect) to Override explicit Items that can
be Potions, Equipment, etc.
